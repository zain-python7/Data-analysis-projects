    "In this plot, we have our four clusters spread across the x-axis, and the dollar amounts for home value and household debt on the y-axis. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to look at in this chart is the different mean home values for the five clusters. Clusters 0 represents households with small to moderate home values, clusters 2 and 3 have high home values, and cluster 1 has extremely high values. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing to look at is the proportion of debt to home value. In clusters 1 and 3, this proportion is around 0.5. This suggests that these groups have a moderate amount of untapped equity in their homes. But for group 0, it's almost 1, which suggests that the largest source of household debt is their mortgage. Group 2 is unique in that they have the smallest proportion of debt to home value, around 0.4.\n",
    "\n",
    "This information could be useful to financial institution that want to target customers with products that would appeal to them. For instance, households in group 0 might be interested in refinancing their mortgage to lower their interest rate. Group 2 households could be interested in a [home equity line of credit](https://www.investopedia.com/home-equity-line-of-credit-heloc-definition-5217473) because they have more equity in their homes. And the bankers, Bill Gates, and Beyoncés in group 1 might want white-glove personalized wealth management. "
